AMADEUS is an advanced prediction model taking into scale the 3D dimensions to be accurately predict the Oil , chemical and other predictions. Earlier predicion models just worked on a 2D model scale which leads to inconsistent results and impractical use of these prediction models . With continuous improvement and work from Microsoft resources we are working on developing this idea so predictions can be used practically in real word scenarios.
