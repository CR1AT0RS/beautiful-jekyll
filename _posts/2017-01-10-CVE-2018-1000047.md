### Kodiak

Kodiak is a C++ library that implements a generic branch and bound algorithm for rigorous numerical approximations. Particular instances of the branch and bound algorithm allow the user to refine and isolate solutions to systems of nonlinear equations and inequalities, global optimization problems, and bifurcation sets for systems of ODEs. Kodiak utilizes interval arithmetic (via the filib++ library) and Bernstein enclosure (for polynomials and rational functions) as self-validating enclosure methods. Symbolic operations support procedures such as automatic partial differentiation.
