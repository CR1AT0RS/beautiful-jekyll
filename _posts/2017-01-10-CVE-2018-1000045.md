Remote Code execution in NASA libraries. Weather satellites/radars uses **Doppler radar**  data for processing weather information. These radars are deployed all across the world. NASA's response was immediate and issues are fixed :) !

Library name: SingleDop

SingleDop is a software module, written in the Python programming language, that will retrieve two-dimensional low-level winds from either real or simulated Doppler radar data.

Turns out radar takes serialized objects to process this data. And it does make sense because the entities/relationships/hierracy are encoded within objects. A malicious entity can carefully craft an object with hidden RCE vector and when the radar processes this data there is remote code execution and sensitive radar systems can be compromised.
