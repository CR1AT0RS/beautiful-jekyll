Remote Code execution in NASA libraries. Weather satellites/radars uses **Doppler radar**  data for processing weather information. These radars are deployed all across the world. NASA's response was immediate and issues are fixed :) !

Llibrary name: PyBlock

PyBlock is a Python 2 or 3 module that enables the end user to estimate partial beam blockage using polarimetric radar data. The methodologies it uses depend on the self-consistency of polarimetric radar variables - reflectivity (Zh), differential reflectivity (Zdr), and specific differential phase (Kdp) - in pure rain.
