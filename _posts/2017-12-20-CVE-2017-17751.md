## RFC 6455
   
   The WebSocket Protocol enables two-way communication between a client
   running **untrusted code in a controlled environment** to a remote host
   that has **opted-in to**communications from that code.  The security
   model used for this is the origin-based security model commonly used
   by web browsers.
   
   ## Websocket 101
    Starts with an HTTP handshake
- Data frames don’t have HTTP overhead
- Data frames don’t have HTTP security
- No headers, cookies, authentication
